# safeguard-unpacked
The unpacked C# DLL for Safeguard Authentication, an authentication system used for malware and DDoS tools. Uploaded for malware analysis and researchers, educational purposes only.

## Proof Safeguard is intended for DDoS programs.
Proof can be seen throughout the files, primarily through functions used for sending "attacks", BotnetObject.cs, and AccountGen.cs.

## Disclaimer
This code itself is not harmful, however it is built for and actively used in malware called "DDoS Panels", this can be seen when scanning on services like virustotal and seeing where it has been found before (Only in hacking tools). Even though this code is not harmful I still ask that it you don't use the code for harmful reasons.
